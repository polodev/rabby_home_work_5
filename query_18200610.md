);
~~~


~~~sql
select arts.title as title, arts.type as type

join arts on arts.id = artist_art.art_id
where artists.name = 'John Smith'
GROUP BY 1;

5) List artist names and the number of artworks developed by each artist.

from artist_art
left join artists on artists.id = artist_art.artist_id
left join arts on arts.id = artist_art.art_id
left join art_presence on art_presence.art_id = artist_art.art_id
limit 10;
